Vision Object Detection with 3D Spatial Information
================================================

![](docs/objdet_range_rviz.png)
<br />

This ROS node processes the outputs from `ti_vision_cnn` (vision CNN for object detection) and `ti_sde` (stereo vision processing), and does the following operations:

1. For each of 2D bounding boxes detected by the object detection CNN node, this node extracts spatial information from the stereo disparity map, and attaches the XYZ coordinates (for the center portion of the bounding box).

2. To provide more spatial information, this node scans the stereo disparity map horizontally, and applies filtering, converts and publishes XYZ point-cloud data. This point-cloud data provides spatial information for potential obstacles that the CNN object detection model may not able to detect (e.g, wall or structure of buildings).

## Demo: 2D Object Detection with XYZ Information

This demo takes stereo camera raw images either from ROSBAG file or live ZED camera with `zed_capture` node, does stereo vision processing in `ti_sde` node, does CNN 2D object detection (with YOLO, SSD, or any other detection model of choice from the Edge AI model zoo) in `ti_vision_cnn` node, followed by `ti_objdet_range` (this node) taking the outputs from the two nodes and does two operations described above. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the demo with ZED camera.
